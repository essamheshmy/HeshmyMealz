# heshmyMealz
It is a simple application for displaying meals. The meals to be displayed are fetched through the API and then displayed to the user
There is a possibility to store these meals in the database using ROOM and Retrofit to display it in offline modes
In this application, I use the latest Android development techniques with the best practices to write clean code that is easy to understand, modify, and develop in the future. I used oop and Solid and design patterns
