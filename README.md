# heshmyMealz
It is an application for displaying meals. The meals that will be displayed are fetched through Api and then displayed to the user. There is a possibility to store these meals in the database.
Hula: In this application, I use everything I learned about Android development. I used Jetpack Compoze with the onion architecture and the MVVM architecture with SOLID Principles. Hula also used the Design Patterns, but I did not find a suitable place for it, so I did not use any of it.
And I'm still working on it
